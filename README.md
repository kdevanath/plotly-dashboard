# plotly-dashboard
Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset revealed a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
Barchart shows the topten microbes found in the navel for selected test subject.
Bubble chart displays for every microbe by color, the size of each bubble tells you the amount of microbes present in the navel given a subject. At a glance you can see wht kind of microbes are present in numbers. When you hover over each bubble or the bubble chart it dipaly the species and sample size.  
You can also see the demographic info.
The guage is useful to see the washing frequence and how it relates to the presence of the microbes.

Did receive a lot of help
